The Beast Empire was an empire of the Twilight period, created by the Beast Cult from the remnants of the Blood Empire and the warring states of the Children of Spirits.

The greatest empire in history, at its peak it covered most of the known world of that time.

# Background

The Beast Cult was a powerful organization during the Ancient Era, but after being outlawed by the Martial League, they went into hiding. Many cultists were killed during persecution, and they found few opportunities until the collapse of the Ancient Era.

# Chronology

## Establishment

After the chaos, the Beast Cult sent their followers to various human settlements, offering peace and power in exchange for worship. Though the cult had been banned in the Ancient Era, in the chaotic period of the Twilight, humanity sought salvation, and stability and peace were important. In time the influence of the cult has grown big enough to establish the Beast Empire.
