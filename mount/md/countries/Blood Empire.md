The Blood Empire was a notorious state created during the Twilight. It became known for its violent expansion. In essence, it was a cult that had its own empire.

The progenitors of vampires.

# Background

After the Ancient Era ended, the human kingdoms and empires collapsed, breaking their connections and leaving humanity fragmented and vulnerable to powerful beasts. The fight over resources led to warring states, each weakened and vulnerable to invaders.

The Seven Sages, seeing humanity's vulnerability, decided to create unity by making a common enemy and create an evil Blood Empire.

# Chronology

## Establishment
As member of the Seven Sages, Ashur followed the order of Adapa and traveled across the world, seeking warlords and leaders who would become immortal vampires by sacrificing others. He created a state whose only goal was expansion through violence. He founded the Blood Cult. 

## Fall
The arrival of the Children of Spirits, together with humans, ended the Blood Empire. The surviving vampires fled to the east. The lands once ruled by the empire were divided among the victorious factions.
